# AMAZON-SALES-DATA-ANALYSIS
This project analyzes an Amazon sales dataset to identify the top-performing products across categories based on customer ratings and popularity. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to clean the data, uncover patterns, and generate insights.
